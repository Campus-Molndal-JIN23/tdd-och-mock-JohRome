# Project Name
tdd-och-mock-JohRome

## Description
By the usage of TDD i can be more sure that my application provides robust and more accurate weather forecasts and thrives to retrieve accurate weather information about a specific city.
I learned that mocking can be quite fun and useful when you need to fake your API responses and not wasting valuable calls.

## Usage
Click on the green <> Code -button and download as .zip.
Open the map and then open the java class of your liking and explore.

## Dependencies and Description
Listed in the pom.xml file.  
* JUnit5 - With JUnit5 you are able to test your code to return expected values. Futhermore you can failproof your methods if tests come out faulty.  
* Mockito - With Mockito you are able to, for this purpose, fake an API-response so you can return expected value.

## Benefit of TDD and Mockito  

**Benefits of TDD**
* Forces you to think about several problematic outcomes and code to prevent them accordingly.  

**Benefits of Mockito**
* Gives you the possibility to test your connection to external sources in a safe enviroment without, for example, waste valuable API calls.


## Test Report

##### Test Summary - 2023/06/07

| Test ID | Test Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status | Comments |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|----------|
| 1       | Passing null value to `getTodaysWeather(String)` | An `IllegalArgumentException` | An `IllegalArgumentException` |   OK    |     No problems identified     |
| 2       | Passing empty String to `getTodaysWeather(String)` | An `IllegalArgumentException` | An `IllegalArgumentException` |   OK    |     No problems identified     |
| 3       | Method call of `getTodaysWeather(String)` returns result | Weather description | Weather description |   OK    |     No problems identified     |
| 4       | Assuring positive temperature is shown | "Temperature: 13.37째C" | "Temperature: 13.37째C" |   OK    |     No problems identified     |
| 5       | Assuring negative temperature is shown | "Temperature: -40.3째C" | "Temperature: -40.3째C" |   OK    |     No problems identified     |

#### Final Words
* The `WeatherService` class appears to be reliable and free from issues based on the tests, which cover basic scenarios.  
However, there are still alot of untested scenarios wich might show their true selves when least needed, like most things in life, for good or bad.
